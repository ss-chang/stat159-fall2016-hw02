## Abstract
In this report, I will reproduce the scatterplot and fitted regression line 
shown in Figure 3.1 (page 62) of _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by 
Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. In addition, 
I will also reproduce the summary regression coefficients shown in Table 3.1 (page 
68) and the quality indices shows in Table 3.2 (page 69). These results are based 
on the `Advertising.csv` dataset that is paired with the textbook, and contains 
data on product sales in over two hundred different markets along with the 
advertising budgets for the product in each market by different media: `TV`, 
`radio`, and `newspaper`.
