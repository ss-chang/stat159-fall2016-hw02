## Abstract
In this report, I will reproduce the scatterplot and fitted regression line 
shown in Figure 3.1 (page 62) of _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by 
Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. In addition, 
I will also reproduce the summary regression coefficients shown in Table 3.1 (page 
68) and the quality indices shows in Table 3.2 (page 69). These results are based 
on the `Advertising.csv` dataset that is paired with the textbook, and contains 
data on product sales in over two hundred different markets along with the 
advertising budgets for the product in each market by different media: `TV`, 
`radio`, and `newspaper`.  

## Introduction
Suppose a company wanted advice on how to increase sales for one of its products. 
There is, of course, no concrete way to insure increased sales, but we can 
influence greater sales through advertising. Imagine that we are statistical 
consultants hired for this project. To convince the company to invest in 
advertising campaigns, we must first prove to the company that there is a 
relationship between advertising and sales. From here, we can then advise the 
company on appropriate advertising budgets to better reach sales targets. Thus, 
the goal for this analysis is to determine whether there is a relationship 
between advertising and sales and, if so, construct an accurate model that can 
be utilized to predict sales based on the size of advertising budget. For the 
purposes of this paper, we suppose that the company is only surveying TV 
advertising; therefore I will only construct analyses for TV advertising budgets 
and sales. This analyses can, however, be extended and compared to all remaining 
mediums in the dataset (radio and newspaper).
